We have an Analyst/Associate program for HR.  If she has an MBA or graduate 
degree we would consider her for the assoc. program.  Otherwise, she might  fit in the analyst program.  Forward her resume to me and I will pass it  along.  She can contact Karen Buckley at 713 345 4667 after you give me the 
resume.  Karen is the lead recruiter/program manager.  Let me know if you  need more info.

Jeanie,
 
I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.  She spoke of 
a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.  Do you know  anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR  related position in general.  She has a few years of experience with a  smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established 
HR department like Enron.  Also, do you have knowledge of specific positions 
we are trying to fill in ENA?  Any info would be helpful.  Thanks.

"Leo,

Well, actually that is how I spell my name as well...but not Enron - one of 
the drawbacks to working for a large company.  Your analysis of the database 
structure and its intent is correct.  The extra table enables the use of a  many-to-many relationship between regulatory items and facilities.  Joanne  and I previously discussed the need to ""keep track"" of all facilities  referenced in a particular order.  This relationship allows users to query  facility and review data related to an order.  For instance, if an order  required the upgrade of chlorination facilities at several plants, one could 
develop a query and report that produced the results of all equipment  inspections for the related facilities.  This would not be possible (or at  least not achieved as easily) without the many to many relationship.  So yes, 
you are giving up functionality, so I would only consider eliminating the  table if it would causing undo problems with the database.  As far as  actually modifying the database, there would be some manual labor required  for those orders with multiple facilities already assigned.  

I have to go, but if you or Joanne need to discuss it over the phone, I'd be 
happy to with a little notice.

I'm real flexible on timing, but this whole - you may not be there thing -  definitely restricts the possibilities.  What are the chances of a follow-on

the better for me, but seriously, I could probably get on plane next weekend

Hey bruddah:

Great to hear from you!!!  So hey, you are ALWAYS welcome stay at my house (as long as you don't water down my liquor bottles...).  The only glitch is that my tenure in PR may be coming to a close.  At this point, our contract is over on January 30th and it's unclear what will happen after that.  When are you thinking of coming?  It sounds like your new job is cool.  The diving is AWESOME!!!

Steve,

Hey, what's up my friend?  I hear that business is well in Puerto Rico (although that was quite awhile ago so who knows).  I'm assuming that you are, indeed, still there.  I can't believe that I've just finished my fifth month with Enron.  It's been great, though.  Everything is new so I'm learning a ton.  Working on a trading floor is quite a different
environment than Pirnie.  My desk is so small it reminds of Puerto Rico, although there are no bomb threats, the bell does not sound at lunch,  and the number of holidays does not exceed the number of work days in the year. I've recently been accepted into a subprogram of the program I'm in to become a trader, so my next year is pretty much planned and eventually I'll start trading.

Anyway... I was just thinking the other day that I miss my trips to the island (especially my accomodations at the Excelsior), and I can't help feeling a little shorted that I didn't get a follow-up event of the Reggae tour or diving trip.  So I was wondering if maybe I should come down some weekend and make it right., you know put all of the planets back in alignment.  So I was wondering if you might be able to put me up for a weekend and maybe do some diving or something.  If not, then no big deal, there's about zillion places I'd like to visit in the next few months. Just drop me a note sometime and let me know what you think.

Please say hello to Pat, Joanne and Juan Carlos for me.  By the way, it was bittersweet to hear Barry left soon after I did.  Had he done so sooner, I would have taken his spot!  Anyway, wish everyone well and I'm curious to hear what's happening on the island these days.

Take care,

How are you feeling today?  I couldn't get to sleep until 11 pm, but I  actually feel pretty good.  I'm excited because Steve H. replied and said I 
could definitely come down, although, he said are contract is over at the end 
of jan and his tour might be over!  still waiting to hear whether a  non-renewal is a realistic possibility or whether its like every other year.  
I thought you mentioned that we got all that 8 mil or whatever of work down 
there.  Interesting.... anyway, I finally got signed up for the continental 
travel specials.  I assume you get them but just incase you wanted to go to 
Louisville, KY or something, I thought I'd send it along.  I'd take  advantage, but I'm have to work a few hours this weekend and I think its a  little late to switch with somebody.  

Well, I should get back to work although it looks like now is just a sit  around and bullshit about California gas period in the day.

Later....

"Tom,

I took a few days off and just got back....

Anyway, I haven't tried it without the key, but if you say it works, then I'm 
sure it does.  One thing I'm realizing, though, is that it's taking me way  too much time to babysit this thing through multiple runs of the model even 
when it does work.  In order to get the full benefit of your model I want to 
run it a zillion times for many different combinations of parameters.  So, if 
you haven't guessed already, I'm wondering how hard it would be to get this 
thing to zip through some preset combinations of parameters and save the  results without me tending to it.  I envision a spreadsheet where I list out 
all of the parameter values for each run, and the model picks out the  parameters, runs through a year's worth of data, and saves the summary sheet, 
then steps to the next set of variables.  In this way I could set it to run a 
bunch of times over night or something so it wouldn't tie up the work day.  
Would this be just a separate macro?  What do you think?

and, boy did i feel great the next day.  Get this....I get on my little rinky 
dink plane to Philadelphia, and as i walk passed the flight attendant, i hear 
this voice.................""mat?"".   I turn and the flight attendant is none 
other than.........Heather Chapin!  Although she offered me all the booz i  could drink, i could drink none.  i would have eaten some food if offered,  but judging by the double-chin she has developed, i'm guessing she ate it all.

Anyway, from what i remember, i had a great time, although a little  dissappointed at the Syracuse'esk finish of the rest of the Brother Jimmy's 
team.  I'll be thinking about you guys this weekend when i'm outside drinking 
my green beer.

About the trips...i don't know anything yet, except that Jazzfest is looking 
bad since no one can seem to find a hotel with availability.

Later,

Hey ya'll.....

Recovered from ""Weekend Lobby"" yet Matt?  Ouch!  Looking forward to hearing 
your reflections on a weekend well spent. Mark, how goes the two ladies you 
are presently juggling?  Thanks for blowing us off yet again!!  Anyway,  wanted to plant a few seeds as far as social outings go....

1) The ski weekend in Burlington, Vermont:
   April (6-8th).  Plan on that

2) MARK: What are the chances with the corp condo in Colorado???? Weekend of the 12-15 in April or the one following??

3) MATT: Jazz Fest?
   May (3-6)???

OK, well, that's about it boys!  Love, Kristen

Hi Matt,
Multiple values for parameters - sounds OK.  I'd add an extra run option to 
the menu bar, and you could set up a list of parameters on a separate tab,  each line corresponding to a complete run.  How about a meeting tomorrow when 
you could tell me what parameters need to be varied?

Tom,

I took a few days off and just got back....

Anyway, I haven't tried it without the key, but if you say it works, then I'm 
sure it does.  One thing I'm realizing, though, is that it's taking me way  too much time to babysit this thing through multiple runs of the model even 
when it does work.  In order to get the full benefit of your model I want to 
run it a zillion times for many different combinations of parameters.  So, if 
you haven't guessed already, I'm wondering how hard it would be to get this 
thing to zip through some preset combinations of parameters and save the  results without me tending to it.  I envision a spreadsheet where I list out 
all of the parameter values for each run, and the model picks out the  parameters, runs through a year's worth of data, and saves the summary sheet, 
then steps to the next set of variables.  In this way I could set it to run a 
bunch of times over night or something so it wouldn't tie up the work day.  
Would this be just a separate macro?  What do you think?

Hi Mat,
I took away your licence key from the back of your PC yesterday.  The  problems with our network licence for the solver have gone away - I do not  really understand what happened.  Try the model aand see if it works OK -  runs fine on my computer now, whereas it did not run 2 weeks ago.  I suspect 
some sort of network problem, and IT have not been able to figure out any  more likely cause.

"Yan,

Based on my review conducted the morning of February 6th, here is a list of 
items that need to be addressed in the next version of the West Desk's Flow 
Summary sheet:

PGT - These numbers appear to be one day off.  The numbers in the Test Sheet 
for February 6th are identical to those used by the West Desk yesterday for 
February 5th.  I verified that they are the Cycle 2 numbers posted on PGT's 
website for the 5th.  Generally, we use the Cycle 2 numbers, however,  sometimes only Cycle one is available for our morning meeting.

Northwest - None of these numbers match our flow sheet.  It appears the Test 
Sheet pulls Cycle 3 nominations, whereas we use Cycle 6.  However, the  website we use to pull the flows is generally not available to use until as 
late as 7 am (we are not sure why).  I understand you may pull the numbers  from a different place, so we should find out whether you can get the numbers 
earlier.

TW - TW numbers appear to be correct, except for the IB Link number.  We pull 
the IB link number from the El Paso Blanco I/C point reported by TW.  It  looks like your sheet pulls the number from the El Paso INWPLBLA point.  They 
differ by about 5,000, but I don't know if one is more correct than the  other.  To be consistent, though, we should probably change the Test Sheet. 
PGE - The numbers also appear to be one day off.  The numbers for February  6th are identical to our Feb. 5th numbers.  Is this a reporting or a  scrubbing problem?  It is possible you are pulling the data from the website 
before they update it with the next day's data.  We manually type these  numbers in.  If you pull from our spreadsheet, then the latest numbers would 
not be in when this report is run.

El Paso - Most of the numbers appear to be correct, except for the plant  receipts.  The numbers are close, but we should compare our formulas because 
I don't think this is a cycle problem.

General - The ""Difference"" column of the Test Sheet compares the latest cycle 
for the current with the final cycle of the previous day.  This can cause  intraday fluxuations in scheduled quantities to appear as day to day  fluxuations.  Any ""Difference"" column should compare identical cycles.  I  suggest that we add additional cycles to the Test Sheet for the current day 
and the previous day.  This way we can compare identical cycles as well as  pick up any intraday fluxuations.

As we discussed, you'll let me know when you're ready to revise this report.  
These notes should give us a great place to start.  I look forward to getting 
this report ready to use.

"Steve,

as we have discussed,  I want to develop a model that can be used to  determine the actual value of storage by looking at deals done in the past.  
In doing this, I need the model to be able to pull historical curves from  Oracle by basis location.  It will need to pull Interest Rate, Gas Daily,  Balance of the month (Swing Swap), Nymex and Basis.

Once all of the pricing curves are pulled, the model will make daily  decisions based on price relative to each other to buy, sell or hold. 
This will probably be an extensive project so see about the pulling of the  curves first, and we can move forward from there.  Please call either myself 
or Matt Smith with any questions.

From: Office of the Chairman on 10/05/2000 07:55 AM
To: ClickatHome mailout
cc:  
Subject: A Computer and Internet Connection for You and Your Family 
As you know, technology is critical to Enron; it drives our success and will 
continue to do so in the future. Technology has helped Enron create new  businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is  responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.  You,ve 
seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to  realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing the 
ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where  technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the 
click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of  Internet knowledge at your family,s fingertips.  

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide  the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in  case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home 
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of  ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy  disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000  software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet  connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time 
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries; 
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT, 
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,  accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being  employed at the time of implementation.  
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of  the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delivery 
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001. 
Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of  your initial questions, we,ve posted a question-and-answer document on  http://clickathome.enron.com.  We will schedule an eSpeak session in the near 
future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can  submit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com. 

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your  family.  We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new level 
by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in  the broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe 
Enron is a great place to work.",kscully@pirnie.com,matt.smith@enron.com,male

"Phillip,

I'm building a sheet for each person specifically for financial hedging.   Each day it will pull in the previous days position and previous day price  curve to calculate the mark to market.  Then that day's transactions can be 
entered to calculate the P & L of transactions which close out previous  positions, as well as to calculate the new open positions.  Initially, I  thought that daily P&L could be calculated by simply adjusting the P&L  whenever a transaction was made by the difference between the bid/offer of  the closed out position by the offer/bid of the new position (of course time 
value and storage costs would be included).  However, this only works if the 
person is 100% hedged, meaning they do not have any open positions which  require marking.  As the seller of synthetic storage utilizing 100% hedging, 
I should be able to do this, except for the fact that I will have size limits 
on transactions that will probably leave me open here and there.   
The main question I have is simply, ""Should I be calculating the P&L for each 
person's storage book for open and closed positions?""  Then beyond that, if 
we do calculate the P&L's from the buyer side, it seems that if their storage 
is not hedged, I will have to develop the market value of the storage in the 
ground and the remaining capacity to mark to market it.  So, I guess I could 
apply the model for that purpose.  Does this make sense to you?  Any comments 
are appreciated.  Thanks.

"Tom,

I believe that your right up correctly interprets the current model, but as 
we discussed, I think the more correct methodology is to use the next day's 
cash price since the Gas Daily print is for gas traded the previous day and 
delivered the same day as the print.  If I'm trading day gas on April 7th,  the prices I'm basing my decisions on are those represented in the Gas Daily 
print for April 8th.  If we do not change the model, I think we need another 
sentence to clarify that the cash prices a day behind.  Of course, eventually 
we need to fix the model.

"Hey, we need to talk.  So far I've gotten Duncan's check and that's it.  I  have not gotten the place yet, since I was waiting for you to tell me that  they are on their way.  Since I have not heard from you, I'm assuming they  are not....so what's up?  I still need everyone's email because I don't not 
have those original messages with everyones address on them.  I think it  would be great if everyone who's commited could send me an email just saying 
when they plan on paying...I guess it's really only your friend and Duncan's 
friend, so I guess it's not really a big deal.  I don't know, I guess I just 
don't have a warm fuzzy feeling because you're the only person I speak to and 
I often times have trouble getting in touch with you, which by the way, you 
never did reply to my email asking how often you read you email so I know  whether I should use it to get in touch with you.

Anyway, I just got back from NYC...had a great time, except for the fact that 
Scully feels the need to build a wall between us.  I can deal, but its just 
kind of annoying.  I just feel the need to put this skiing thing to bed  quickly.

Hey baby,
If you haven't already, I say let's go with the 22nd-25th in Feb.  We have our six and can add on others as they fill in, but I'm done waiting for people to get back to me!!!! Did you get my card yet?
Can't wait!!!

The snow was heavy on Sunday but what a great time!!!   Last night I took a lesson and we hit the moguls (or as those ""in the know"" refer to them as, ""the bumps"").  What a rush.  My ski's are a tad long for me (180's) and so it was tough at first but about three runs into it I started feeling the rhythm and that was it....total addiction!!

So what's going on???

love, k

"Regan,

Hey, I hope things are still going well.  I've been thrown right into the mix 
right away and have barely had a minute to breathe.  I'm scheduling gas after 
the morning trades have been made which basically entails lining up the  buyers and sellers to exchange contract numbers.  However, it's a great place 
to learn operational logistics.  The intent is that I'll be productive in the 
role immediately while learning the ropes.  As they hire the needed full-time 
schedulers and I get up to speed, I'll move into market research for the  traders.  My first such assignment is to value storage in different markets 
based on historical gas pricing and injection-withdrawel strategies.  Let's 
just say my plate looks to be full.

By the way, I'm sure you saw the previous email from our buddy, Ted Bland.  
Looks like he got the message, although I'm still feeling like there's still 
some orientation regarding the A/A program itself that we're missing.  For  instance, did you see that there's a whole page in the intranet dedicated to 
the program.  It mentions month guest speakers and lunches.  I also saw  mention of a mentoring program.  Of course, the A/A happy hours important as 
well.  I'd like to know more. 

Anyway, the real reason I wanted to drop the line is to find out if you're  spending all your time in Georgia, or if you want to grab lunch sometime this 
week or hear of any after work activities that would help in meeting other  people at Enron.  You can reach me at 3-0472.

okay, i'm taking a break from trying to figure out this excel spreadsheet i'm 
working with.  it took me forever to remember how to use pivot tables.  it's 
pretty interesting though once i get past all the annoying parts. 
well, i really would prefer to explain my thoughts to you through another  media (i.e., speaking to you), but i guess you need to know asap, so i'll  attempt it through email (even though i HATE email for explaining my thoughts 
b/c there's always misunderstandings).  i guess the reason i'm very hesitant 
about you coming is b/c i don't know what you expect from the visit.  we both 
know things are obviously different b/w us more recently than they had been 
when you initially moved.  i'm not sure about the reasons you feel different 
about me, but i can attempt to explain the reasons i feel different about  you.  first, we don't really see each other often and that obviously makes  someone feel less for a person, regardless of who it is (you have agreed with 
this).  second, since i started my job and have other things going on in my 
life, i realized that nothing will happen with us and i don't like being  emotionally tied to someone knowing nothing will happen.  so, i've tried to 
get rid of all my feelings for you.  also, i don't like limiting myself as if 
something will happen. i don't know about you, but regardless of how much we 
said we weren't anything and we were free to do what we want, there was still 
a limit on what we could do.  with us visiting each other (in more than a  friendly way), i felt somewhat limited. by limited i mean i always felt i  could not be even slightly serious with someone else with us visiting each  other as more than just friends.  don't worry, there isn't anyone else, it's 
just the thought of feeling limited if the opportunity arises that i don't  like (especially when i've realized it's hopeless to expect anything with  us).  so, i guess the reason i'm nervous about your visit is b/c i think you 
would want it to be like our other visits (i.e., you stay over my place...in 
my bed...and we hang out together all weekend) where i don't think i want  that.  i would like if you visited, but not how we usually visit.  those are 
my thoughts (although not clearly explained b/c of hte email thing).

Multiple values for parameters - sounds OK.  I'd add an extra run option to

Tom,

I took a few days off and just got back....

Anyway, I haven't tried it without the key, but if you say it works, then I'm 
sure it does.  One thing I'm realizing, though, is that it's taking me way  too much time to babysit this thing through multiple runs of the model even 
when it does work.  In order to get the full benefit of your model I want to 
run it a zillion times for many different combinations of parameters.  So, if 
you haven't guessed already, I'm wondering how hard it would be to get this 
thing to zip through some preset combinations of parameters and save the  results without me tending to it.  I envision a spreadsheet where I list out 
all of the parameter values for each run, and the model picks out the  parameters, runs through a year's worth of data, and saves the summary sheet, 
then steps to the next set of variables.  In this way I could set it to run a 
bunch of times over night or something so it wouldn't tie up the work day.  
Would this be just a separate macro?  What do you think?

Dude

sorry for the long response period - howz it???

So the saga continues - we have no contract extension - in fact - today in March 1 and our contract ended yesterday - it is anticipated that we will get an extension through March - but it hasn't happened yet - aye bendito!!!

In a way I hope the whole thing just blows up so I can go hang in the Caymans for a while - how sweet would that be???

anyway, March is not looking that good - going to CA on the 17,18 - got a chickie visiting 24/25 - and going to NY for the Pirnie technical symposium on the 3/31 and 4/1...  how did life get so freekin' hectic.

I'll keep you posted

Hey, what's up my friend?  I hear that business is well in Puerto Rico  (although that was quite awhile ago so who knows).  I'm assuming that you  are, indeed, still there.  I can't believe that I've just finished my fifth 
month with Enron.  It's been great, though.  Everything is new so I'm  learning a ton.  Working on a trading floor is quite a different environment 
than Pirnie.  My desk is so small it reminds of Puerto Rico, although there 
are no bomb threats, the bell does not sound at lunch,  and the number of  holidays does not exceed the number of work days in the year.  I've recently 
been accepted into a subprogram of the program I'm in to become a trader, so 
my next year is pretty much planned and eventually I'll start trading. 
Anyway... I was just thinking the other day that I miss my trips to the  island (especially my accomodations at the Excelsior), and I can't help  feeling a little shorted that I didn't get a follow-up event of the Reggae  tour or diving trip.  So I was wondering if maybe I should come down some  weekend and make it right., you know put all of the planets back in  alignment.  So I was wondering if you might be able to put me up for a  weekend and maybe do some diving or something.  If not, then no big deal,  there's about zillion places I'd like to visit in the next few months.  Just 
drop me a note sometime and let me know what you think.

Please say hello to Pat, Joanne and Juan Carlos for me.  By the way, it was 
bittersweet to hear Barry left soon after I did.  Had he done so sooner, I  would have taken his spot!  Anyway, wish everyone well and I'm curious to  hear what's happening on the island these days.

This one is very similar to the one you just did.  In fact, the data is  almost identical.  We download power plant outage data from the California  ISO website (manual until you guys get some free time to set up an automated 
scrape).  Anyway, the data gets into an Access database of mine in a table  with key fields:  Date and Res Name.  The other fields include Type (planned 
or unplanned), Owner, Location, plant capacity, and of course, the quantity 
of the outage.  So, we need basically the large table as the one you did  which lists each plant and the outage for ""today"" and let's say 1 week in the 
past.  We cannot go in the future because the data gets posted daily for that 
day only.  Then the other table will just summarize the total ""Planned"" and 
""Unplanned"" by region.   A copy of the database is attached.  Let me know  when you have a chance to start working on it.  Thanks.

Here's the information for the Portland database:

Machine name:  napdx-sql1

The Access database I created is located at:  O:\\fundy_ops\west  desk\generation database\power_link_database.mdb

The qry_curtailments is the query i'm currently using (although it only has 
fields for today and yesterday, and i think i need more).  The tables for the 
query are dbo_LkpOUT_PlantCharacteristics and dbo_LkpOUT_PlantOutage. 
In general, I think I need two tables.  One needs to show each plant and the 
other needs to summarize the outages by region and fuel type (both in the  Plant table).  I don't really have a query that prepares the data for the  summary table.  the other two queries in the Access database are a start.   The attached Excel file has two sheets with what I would ideally like the  report to look like.  It might be good to group the first table by region and 
then fuel type as well.  When you have a chance to look this stuff over, I'd 
be happy to discuss it further.  Thanks.

The GISB working session was as exciting as you would expect it to be.  Most 
of the early termination and alternative damages provision concepts were  hammered out.  A law firm (Shook & Shook) volunteered to draft language for 
the concepts agreed to in time for next Friday's committee meeting.  There  was lot of discussion of what is going on in California and how the early  termination process should work.  Enron should be fine with all of the  concepts except the law firm was pushing an extremely broad set off right.  I 
don't think that is will go cross affiliates but it will go across  contracts.  We will have to see the actual words.  I will attend the next  meeting most likely by phone.  Hope things are going well.  See you in 13  days.

Jeff Hodge asked that I respond to your e-mail.  

ENA does use the GISB contract to conduct its ""spot"" business.  By ""spot"", I 
mean interruptible gas deals of any length and firm deals one month or less 
in duration.  Enron also has its own form of spot agreement that we use.  I 
have attached a copy of that agreement.

We do try to negotiate some special provisions into each GISB.  Our current 
version of the special provisions is included in the GISB agreement that is 
attached.  I do not know of any company that uses the GISB as-is. 
We do not use the GISB for firm deals that are greater than one month in  duration.  For those deals, we use our Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale  Agreement that I have attached.

If you need copies of actual confirmations, Bob Bowen or Ellen Wallumrod  would be able to give you examples.  Form confirmations are at the back of  each of the agreements attached.

terms and not necessarily with the same lenders.

2) NUI Corp. does not have credit rating since the reorganization.  The  credit rating should be tied to NUI Utilities.

3) The MAC should be BBB instead of BBB- for Customer.

4) NUI Utilities no longer owns the common stock of Elizabethtown and City  Gas.  They are now divisions of NUI Utilities.

Good morning, Stacy.
 I have reviewed the Guaranty forwarded last evening by Rudwell
Johnson.  He requested that I get back to you with comments.  Please note my
changes on the attached.  As Rudwell suggested, in the second paragraph  I have included language that limits this Guaranty to the two transactions that we working on.  In the same vein, I have also included language (see paragraph 17) that ensures that any other guarantees will not be cumulative with this one.  I assume that we will do a separate guaranty to use as Exhibit D to the Master Purchase Agreement.  Any questions, please call me at 908-719-4228.

Long time since I placed one of these to you. . . 

Okay, 
NORTHEAST GAS MARKETS, LLC; An EOL approved CP (Investment Grade); We have  have a new GISB [Choice of Law = NY] & a Special provision (13.10) that I  haven't come across yet whereas  - - - - - -  Enron recognizes that NEGM is 
acting as buyer on behalf of certain companies (""Repurchasers"") to who it  immediately resells such gas at the Delivery  Points, The Parties further  agree that the term ""transporter"" shall include any company acting in the  capacity of a transporter for any Repurchaser & agree that 4.3 will apply to 
invoices from such Transporters for Imbalance Charges received. - - - - - I 
can't see any reasons why this should cause this GISB to be excluded from EOL 
transactions, but wanted to make sure that there wasn't some deeper intent  for the special provision that we would want to keep On-line transactions on 
GTCs.

Anything we should beware of?

"Ed and Mark, 

As we discussed, I spoke to Jeff Hodge and Travis McCullough about the best 
way to document this deal.  We all agreed that it is better to document the 
deal as a deferred payment on the sale of natural gas rather than as a loan.  
Documenting the deal as a loan does not add any protection for Enron and in 
fact, may be detrimental because of the various laws concerning loans and  lenders.  The protections  and remedies afforded by the Master track those  that Enron would have under a loan document.  Enron would be in no better  position to collect from NUI in the event of bankruptcy under a loan document 
than under the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.  Additionally, I assume 
that NUI, being a regulated utility, will not want to or be able to document 
this deal as a loan.

Hi Stacy,

Bridgette Anderson is currently briefing a new Enfolio Master Purchase Sale 
Firm with Cargill, but it is not an ""Enfolio II"".  It has provisions for  collateral and includes an Enron guaranty and limited power of attorney. 
I know if it said ""Enfolio II"", it would be okay to use it in EOL, and I  believe it is good for EOL, but I want to confirm that with you.  Also,  what's the difference between the two contracts?  Is it just the collateral 
provisions and guaranty that make it different?  I'd attach a copy, but it  hasn't been scanned yet.

Thanks,

Stacy -

I will have to look at the ICE agreement and see if we can add affiliates to 
the agreement.  Since the agreement was negotiated, if they cannot add us to 
the current agreement, then they should be able to submit a similar version 
for enovate to use.

Stacy - 
Steve spoke with Coral about the Transaction Agreements today.  They had the 
following comments:
Transaction Agreement #1
1 - MaxDQ should be 20,346
2 - 3.2 and 3.4 - LD payment equal to $0.15 plus 1.7% x Spot Price rather  than $0.017 x Spot Price

Transaction Agreement #2
1 - 3.2 and 3.4 - LD payments consistent with Transaction Agreement #1 rather 
than $0.20 and $0.25

I think these are all fine, but I wanted to run them by you.  I have made the 
requested revisions to the attached Agreements for your review.  Let me know 
what you think.

"Daniel, 

I do remember working on an assignment agreement regarding the assignment of 
the Columbia Energy contracts with MSCGI  to Enron North America Corp.  I  will need to find the document.

It is my understanding that, with the exception of one deal, all the deals  between ENA and MSCGI are firm deals of greater than one month duration.  ENA 
uses the GISB for month or less firm deals and interruptible deals of any  length as recommended by the Gas Industry Standards Board.  For firm deals  that are longer than one month, ENA uses a master firm agreement if one  exists.  If there is no master firm agreement, we send out our General Terms 
and Conditions with our confirmation.  That answers your question of why  Ellen sent our GTC when there is a GISB in place.

It appears to me that you and I need to work on getting a master firm  agreement in place.  Please let me know your thoughts.

Please note that we have a Transfer and Termination Agreement (dated January

GISB was not referenced in the Transfer and Termination Agreement, so I'm  assuming the GISB survived the termination process. 

Did our two companies enter into an assignment & novation agreement, or other

 I though it might be helpful to review where we stand on the various agreements:

 1. Enfolio Agreement between NUI Utilities and ENA - The version (including all Exhibits) that Stacy sent on April 11 (5:23 p.m.) is the final and is acceptable.  I have asked Terri Sue to forward NUI's Notice Information (Exhibit A) to Stacy.  Stacy, upon receipt, can you please generate the final agreement?
 2. Physical Transaction Agreement - I need to review Section 4 with Bob Lurie who will be back in the office tomorrow.
 3. April Transaction Confirmation Letter - Stacy, this letter should be addressed to Thomas E. Smith, Director, Energy Planning (who signed the Confirmation).  Also, please confirm that the Exhibits are NUI Confirmation Nos. 31060 and 46669.
 3. Swap Transaction Agreements - I am attaching a revised version of the Transaction Agreement and Exhibit for Swap V09140.4 from Enron's review.
As Mark and I discussed, NUI Corporation, not NUI Utilities, will be the Guarantor. In addition, I have modified the form of Guaranty to make it clear that it only applies to these two Swaps; this is similar to what Enron
had agreed to when we were contemplating an NUI Corp. Guaranty for the Enfolio Agreement.  I have made this change to the Guaranty because I am not
satisfied that the discussion within the Confirmation that purports to limit
the scope of the Guaranty is sufficient.  I think the limitations need to be
set forth within the four corners of the Guaranty itself.   If acceptable, the same changes should be made to the Transaction Agreement and Exhibit for
Swap V09140.5.

Per our conversation, attached is a revised draft Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement between enovate and Oxy for your comment.  With respect to Mary's last draft, I have changed Section 2.4 back to having enovate only sending confirmations.  Other changes that were previously made by Mary were in Section 2.3 which now allows either party can maintain recording equipment and Section 8.2 which reinstated the original transfer language.

Let me know if you have other questions or changes to be made before it goes

are ""special provisions"" consisting of one page; (b) add ""and recorded under
Section 13.11"" to the language at the top of Appendix 1, and (c) change the word ""Transporter"" to ""Transporter(s)"" in Appendix 1, Section 11.2, last word.

 Contact and other MCN information needs to be filled in on the cover sheet.

"Gregg, 

My thoughts on Allegheny's changes to the Master are similar to Mary's.  I am 
generally fine with the changes except 1) I would counter with lowering the 
liquidated damages to 10 cents (ultimately, this is a business decision)  and 
2) I would tell them that we need arbitration.  In some respects, it is more 
likely that disputes would arise under this type of deal so it is even more 
important to have arbitration. Please let me know if you want me to talk to 
anyone at Allegheny about their changes.

Attached is a draft guaranty from Gulf Resources to cover physical  transactions between their sub, Crestar Energy Marketing and ENA.  Can you  please review this format and provide your comments.  The guaranty covers  purchase/sale and swap transactions, although our primary exposure is only  physical natural gas.  I am not sure if one of the financial attorney's needs 
to look at this too

To prepare the confirmation for this deal, we need to make a few changes to 
the standard form:

1. Incorporate the revolver document  Articles 3-7 by reference that I  forwarded earlier.  I think this is the easiest way. We will need to make the 
appropriate modifications to change for our transaction type. Laura Falk at 
the company should be able to provide us with whatever information we need  (name of agreement, parties to, etc). She can be reached at 908-719-4242.   Since NUI must already comply with all of this for the bank, it should not be 
too burdensome for them.  If they push back, I have marked the specific  sections that we need to include at a minimum.

2. We need to delete the reference to the collateral threshold and  requirement to post performance assurance in the Master.

3. Do we need to do anything about the fact that in some cases we have  redundant and perhaps conflicting defaults/remedies?  Or can we just state  that anything we incorpoarate from the revolver document supercedes the  Master, if applicable?

Can you think of anything else that I am missing?

Hey.  I've been so busy.  Most of May was a whirlwind.  John's sister, Lynn, got married two weekends ago.  Then, we went on vacation for the past week to Kiahwah.  Oh, and I switched jobs.   I am now the Managing Director of our internal trading platform.  I miss Jennifer, she was really great to work with.  Such a nice person.

How have you been?  How is Merideth?  I took a cute picture of her sleeping from when you were over and she had tired herself out from crying (hee, hee).  Anything else new with you?  Paige had her baby.  A little boy named William after his pop.  She has taken to motherhood and absolutely loves it.  She's even talking about #2 already.  She's always been a kind of crazy that way!

Call me when you get a chance.  I still have the same work number (713-207-1341) and John is out traveling all week so I have time to chat at night, too (713-432-0470).  Not that I wouldn't have time to chat if he was around!

Rudwell- Pursuant to our discussion, attached please find a revised draft of
the Enfolio Agreement between CPS and enovate LLC.  The form of agreement is
the original one used by Enron and edited accordingly for enovate LLC. 
The edits proposed (as submitted to enovate back in January) are consistent with industry standards and according to my notes were being forwarded to enovate's Legal (Enron) for further review.   We are continuing contact and discussions to this matter with Roy Rodriguez at enovate and hope we can put

Brad:

I got your message late Friday.  The B & J Gas and Oil deal was done on  2/10/2000 for 10,000 a month @ $2.70 for one year (March, 2000 - February 28, 
2001).  The confirmation was sent in care of Bowie, Inc., another of our  customers from whom he had purchased this production, and who received his  revenue and did his distributions at the time.  I got another copy from Stacy 
Dickson, ENA attorney, last week and faxed it to Bowie to review with Cawthon.

This was not paid correctly by the payables department, and was paid at the 
index instead of the fixed price.  We sent the deal ticket to Wade Price the 
day the deal was done, but it was not paid correctly.  This causes these  kinds of problems.

I am attaching some notes from my phone log where I had discussions with B & 
J (Cawthon) and Bowie at the time I locked him in, as well as conversations 
later in March when he said he had not received his confirmation (it was sent 
again).  Call me if you need anything further.

One more for the pile.  IDACORP has requested that 100% of the guaranty they 
receive on behalf of enovate to be issued by Peoples.  Peoples has prepared 
the attached reimbursement agreement which would obligate ENA to 50% of any 
payments made by Peoples under their guaranty.  We have issued several of  these, going both directions.  Jeff is familiar with the concept if you have 
any questions.  Can you please review the reimbursement agreement, and if  acceptable, prepare execution copies with initials?  This has a lower level 
of priority than the storage deals with Nicor and Coral which begin April 1.  

Any questions or comments, please let me know.

Stacy - one quick question regarding the Coral Transaction Agreements, is it 
your interpretation that the fuel charge, 1.7%, would also apply to the  credits to the MTV resulting from our non-perfomance?  We tried to make that 
more specific under the Nicor agreement.  Steve has discussed the concept  with Coral and they seem to be fine with it.  However, Coral's only change to 
the fuel charge language was including the term ""sold"".  Do you think this is 
sufficient, or should we be more specific?

Hi Debra!

As per our conversation, attached is Constellation Power's comments to the  Master Firm agreement they received from 
Roy Rodriguez.  I will be happy if you can review this.  Additionally, as  soon as I come to some agreement with their credit group regarding threshold 
and MACs, I will draft a credit worksheet and forward same to you. 

Thanks
Rudwell.

Rudwell- Pursuant to our discussion, attached please find a revised draft of
the Enfolio Agreement between CPS and enovate LLC.  The form of agreement is
the original one used by Enron and edited accordingly for enovate LLC. 
The edits proposed (as submitted to enovate back in January) are consistent with industry standards and according to my notes were being forwarded to enovate's Legal (Enron) for further review.   We are continuing contact and discussions to this matter with Roy Rodriguez at enovate and hope we can put
closure to this agreement in the very near future.

"Heather,

I am glad to hear you (and your car) are o.k.  We did not have any problems.  
Those pictures are amazing!  The video of I-10 was unbelievable.  Dan and  Marianne went to I-10 and saw the flooding in person.  He said the video on 
tv did not really show how bad it was.  Is there an estimate on when B  & P 
will be back in their offices?  It would be nice for you to have a couple of 
days off.

"Introducing your first SAP Paycheck!

This is the first payroll processed in SAP for all employees paid out of  Corporate Payroll. You may notice some changes in the way information is  reflected on your pay advice, the most common are itemized below. 
What,s Different?
? Your +home, cost center will be displayed at the top of the pay advice. 
This is your department number as designated in the HR and financial modules 
of SAP.

? Any earnings descriptions that start with a +P, represent earning types 
reported in the prior period. For instance, if you reported vacation time for 
the July 1st-15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay  advice as +PVacation,.

? Flex dollars will appear on the earnings section of the pay advice instead 
of as a credit in the deduction section. The various benefit deductions will 
remain itemized in the deduction section.

? If you transfer between Enron companies during the year, your year)to-date 
totals will carry forward to the new company pay advice. Previously, the  year-to-date totals started over when transferred to another company. This  change will provide your total Enron earnings and deduction amounts on your 
pay advice throughout the year.  (Note that your W2 at the end of the year  will reflect your earnings by company).

? For salaried employees, any reported exception time (e.g. vacation, sick  day, etc.) will be reflected on the earnings section with hours only, the  related dollar amount will be included in the +Salary, earnings type.  
? For any other information or further explanations regarding your payroll  contact the Payroll Call Center at 713-345-5555



Payroll FAQ,s

My paycheck has a line called &other deductions8, what does that stand for?
There is a fixed amount of lines to print deductions on the paycheck.  For  some employees, the number of deductions are more than we have room to  print.  In this circumstance, the system totals all remaining deductions and 
prints them on one line ) titled &other deductions8.  The detail of all  deductions can be viewed on the pay advice that is displayed on the intranet 
at eHRonline.enron.com.

What do the earnings or deduction codes on my paycheck mean?
These definitions are listed on the Payroll webpage located at 
hrweb.enron.com, select Enron Payroll  from the side index.

Why is my overtime not reflected on my paycheck?
Overtime is paid one pay period in arrears, therefore it will be reflected in 
the next pay period. For example, if you reported overtime for the  July 1st )15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay advice 
as +POvertime,.

What is the limit for Social Security (FICA)?
For year 2000 the limit is $4,724.40 on a wage base of $76,200. This limit is 
applied to each Enron payroll tax company. Therefore, if you transfer to  another Enron company these limits will start over, however, the total amount 
withheld across all companies will be reflected on your paystub. Excess FICA 
will be credited to you by the IRS via your tax return.

What federal income tax rate is used for my bonus or when I exercise stock  options?
There is a standard federal income tax rate of 28% for these earnings. This 
can be higher if the employee has completed a Supplemental Tax form  requesting a higher rate (this form can be found at hrweb.enron.com , select 
Enron Payroll  from the side index).",all.employees@enron.com,enron.announcements@enron.com,unknown

"As evidenced by an exceptionally strong performance in the second quarter,  Enron,s wholesale energy businesses in North America and Europe continue to 
experience tremendous growth.  The opportunities to continue to grow our  natural gas and power businesses have never been better and it is critical to 
Enron,s future success that we remain focused on expanding these businesses 
and maintaining the strong momentum we have in these markets.

It is equally important that we continue to develop new businesses outside of 
gas and electricity, which can make significant contributions to our earnings 
growth.  We have made significant progress in developing these businesses in 
North America, Europe, and most recently in our new Net Works business unit.  
Included in these global businesses are our efforts in crude and products,  coal, emissions, insurance, currency, equity trading, interest rates, credit 
trading, paper and pulp, and metals.

While significant progress has been made in these efforts we need to  accelerate the growth of these new businesses while continuing to  aggressively expand our core gas and electricity businesses in North America 
and Europe.  In order to accomplish these two objectives and to capitalize on 
the increasingly global opportunities in these new businesses we are today  announcing the formation of a new business unit ) Enron Global Markets.  This 
new business unit will focus on markets and commodities which are global in 
scope, but outside our traditional gas and power markets.  This new core  business unit will operate in parallel with and in close coordination with  the North American and European businesses.

Enron Global Markets will be headed by Mike McConnell, President and Chief  Executive Officer, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer.  They will  report to Mark Frevert who will be Chairman of Enron Global Markets.  Mark, 
Mike and Jeff will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron Global  Markets.

Included in this new business unit and reporting to the Office of the  Chairman will be the following businesses and their leaders:
- Global Crude and Products:  John Nowlan
- Coal:   George McClellan
- Currency, equities, interest rate and agricultural trading:  Gary Hickerson
- Insurance and weather:   Jere Overdyke

Enron,s metals business and Enron Credit.com will remain the responsibility 
of Enron Europe. The Paper and Pulp business will continue to reside in North 
America. 

With the departure of Mike McConnell from Enron Net Works, we are pleased to 
announce the following appointments in that business unit:
- Jeff McMahon: President and Chief Operating Officer
- Louise Kitchen: Chief Commercial Officer
- Philippe Bibi:  Chief Technology Officer

Jeff, Louise and Philippe, along with Greg Whalley,  will comprise the Office 
of the Chairman for Enron Net Works.

With Jeff Shankman,s departure from Enron North America,s natural gas  operation, all of Jeff,s direct reports will report to John Lavorato. 
We are also pleased to announce the following changes to the Enron North  America Office of the Chairman.  John Lavorato will join the ENA Office of  the Chairman as Chief Operating Officer.  Dave Delainey will assume the role 
of President and Chief Executive Officer.  Mark Frevert will retain his role 
as Chairman of Enron North America in addition to his role as Chairman of  both Enron Global Markets and Enron Europe.

Please join us in congratulating everyone in their new assignments and in  supporting the new Enron Global Markets organisation.",all.worldwide@enron.com,office.chairman@enron.com,unknown

view is on many of the points.  I hope you could understand some of my confusion on how the dinner went.

I do not think it will be easy for either group to put it behind us.  I hope
you understand that you are an important customer for us (which is why the entire gulf desk went to dinner with you) and earning and keeping your respect is important.  We have a long way to go in that area.

I hope things will be better today.  I am not going to have the Gulf desk turn on the box until I hear from you.  I apologize that I did not catch the
""box time"" on Thursday due to the scattered  schedules the Gulf desk was keeping along with myself (long conference call); otherwise, you would have had a call from me when things settled down that day.

Sincerely,

Steve

Jeff will assume the role at a time when the company is hitting on all  cylinders and is positioned for phenomenal growth.  He is clearly ready for 
the job, and after 15 years as CEO of this great company, I,m ready for a  somewhat different role.

Our succession plan has been clear for some time.  This has afforded Jeff and 
me the freedom to combine our strengths toward building a company that  continues to exceed everyone,s expectations, including our own.  We look  forward to furthering that relationship as Jeff expands his role.

this is cute.  


  Not long ago and far away, Santa was getting ready for his annual   trip...but there were problems everywhere. Four of his elves got sick, and
  the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the regular ones so   Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind schedule. 
  Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mom was coming to visit. This stressed
  Santa even more.

  When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were   about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out, heaven   knows where. More Stress.

  Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the boards cracked and the   toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys.

  Totally frustrated, Santa went into the house for a cup of coffee and a   shot of whiskey. When he went to the cupboard, he found the elves had hit   the liquor and there was nothing to drink. In his frustration, he dropped   the coffee pot and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the   kitchen floor. He went to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the   straw it was made from.

  Just then the door bell rang and Santa cussed on his way to the door. 
  He opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas
  tree.

  The angel said: ""Where would you like to put this tree fat man?"" 
  And that my friend, is how the little angel came to be on top of the   Christmas tree.",sandra.brawner@enron.com,andrea.ring@enron.com,unknown

         Learn the ins and outs of filing after mid-April 
deadline 

         By GARY KLOTT 
         Tribune Media 

         For the many millions of individuals who have yet 
to file their 2000 income tax returns, there is no
         reason to panic. 

         If you need more time to file your return, you can 
easily get a filing extension. 

         And if you can't afford to pay your tax bill now, 
you can buy more time to pay up. While you may be
         subject to interest and penalties for payments  made after April 16, you can put off the day of
         reckoning for months without fear that IRS  collection agents will come after you. There is even a
         loophole in the law that will enable many  individuals to get an extra month to pay up without being
         assessed interest or penalties. 

         Nevertheless, April 16 is a critical deadline for 
anyone who has yet to file his tax returns. You'll need
         to file either your tax return or an extension  request by the deadline. And to avoid interest and
         penalties, you'll generally need to pay any taxes 
owed by April 16. 

         April 16 is also the deadline for making IRA  contributions for 2000 returns and for making the first
         installment of quarterly estimated taxes for 2001. 

         Filing extension: If you'd like more time to file 
your return, getting a filing extension is simple. In fact,
         the IRS has expanded the options this year for  obtaining a filing extension. You can now do it by
         phone, computer or mail. 

         The traditional way to get an extension is to fill 
out IRS Form 4868, ""Application for Automatic
         Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income 
Tax Return"" and mail it to the IRS by the April 16
         deadline. If you're using tax-preparation software 
or a tax professional, you can file your extension
         request by computer. Or you can phone in your  extension request by calling 888-796-1074. 

         If you owe the IRS money, another option for  requesting an extension is to make the payment by
         credit card (American Express, Discover or  MasterCard) on the Internet or by phone through one
         of the two companies the IRS has authorized for  processing credit card payments. Details on the
         option are included in the Form 4868 instructions. 

         By making the extension request, the IRS will  automatically give you four more months, until Aug.
         15, to file your return. 

         You can get an extension for any reason. No  explanation is asked for when requesting an extension. 

         But be aware that your extension request only  gives you extra time to file your return, not to pay
         your taxes. To avoid interest and possible penalty 
charges, you must estimate how much you owe
         and make the payment with your extension request 
by the April 16 deadline. 

         Unable to pay: If you can't afford to pay your tax 
bill, you should at least file an extension request by
         the April 16 deadline. 

         Though you'll be subject to interest and possible 
penalty charges for late payment of your taxes,
         you'll avoid being hit with a late-filing penalty, 
which runs a steep five percent a month (up to a
         maximum 25 percent.) 

         Installment plan: If you still don't have the cash 
to pay your taxes by the time your extension runs out
         on Aug. 15, you can negotiate with the IRS to pay 
your balance due in monthly installments. You
         make the request for an installment agreement when 
you file your completed tax return using Form
         9465, ""Installment Agreement Request.""  
         ""Offer in compromise"": If you can't afford to pay 
all you owe in taxes, even in installments over a
         period of years, you may be able to work out a  settlement with the IRS. The IRS recently expanded
         its ""Offer in Compromise"" program, in which  taxpayers in tough financial situations can offer to settle
         for less than they owe. Offers are submitted using 
IRS Form 656, ""Offer in Compromise."" 

         A loophole offers an extra month to pay up: If all 
you need is an extra month or so to come up with
         the cash to pay your tax bill, there is a way you 
may be able to get a short reprieve without being
         subject to interest or penalties. 

         All you need do is take the IRS up on its offer to 
calculate your tax bill for you. 

         If you're eligible for the offer, fill out your  tax return, stopping short of computing certain totals, and
         send it in by April 16. The IRS will compute your 
tax and send you a bill for any tax owed. If you
         pay within 30 days of the notice, you won't be  assessed any penalties or interest. 

         To take advantage of the loophole, your taxable  income must be less than $100,000 and you can't
         itemize deductions. The full list of eligibility 
requirements and step-by-step instructions are contained
         in IRS Publication 967, ""The IRS Will Figure Your 
Tax."" 

         Retirement account contributions: If you hope to 
contribute to an Individual Retirement Account, the
         final deadline for 2000 tax-year contributions is 
April 16, even if you obtain a filing extension. 

         The deadline is more flexible for self-employed  retirement plans. Contributions to Keogh or
         Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plans can be  made up until the due date of your return, which
         can be later than April 16 with a filing  extension. 

         Estimated tax deadline: For self-employed workers 
and other individuals who need to make
         quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS, April 
16 also is the deadline for making the first
         installment for 2001.",kennethbrawner@msn.com,sandra.brawner@enron.com,female

Sandra,
???? 
???? The email that you sent me last Thursday has bothered me the entire  weekend.? That is why I am emailing you from home.? I just want you to know 
my true intention of the email I sent you that day.
???? First and foremost,?I invited you and Kenny out for drinks, or a dinner, 
as friends.? I repeat,?""as friends"" and nothing more.? I said in that email 
that business does not have to be discussed and?I meant it.? As far as  the?Enron/Natsource?""deal"" that you are talking about.....it had nothing to 
do with the email I sent you.? As far as I know, that ""deal"" has been in the 
works since September/October between Jack Cogan and Andy Zipper.? So I want 
it to be clear to you that the ""deal"" had nothing to do with me sending you 
that email.
???? As a matter of fact, the reason why I sent you that email and invited  you out was because of the last time we spoke.? Remember when I instant  messaged you?? The reason why I approached you that way was because I thought 
we were close enough friends that I could.? As?I found out, I was wrong.?  However, when I spoke to you that day, on the phone, and asked if I could ask 
you out in the future ( when?I come to Houston).....you said I could.? I have 
planned to come down for weeks.? Even though you choose to not deal with  Natsource, I still considered you a?friend and thought it would be  appropriate to ask you out.....and so?I did.
???? As you know, I take things to heart.? I was really upset with  the?response I got from you.? I am emailing you from home because it bothered 
me so much that I needed to make sure you understood my true intentions.? I 
hope I have done that.
???? Finally, I just want to say that I will not bother you again.? I just  want you to know that?I have always tried to do the right thing.? I feel as 
though you are questioning everything I say or do and that you believe there 
are?ulterior motives behind my actions.....and it just isn't true!??With  that, I wish nothing but good things for you and your family.
?
???? good bye,

I visited with Kam earlier today to revisit the positions in the SE book and 
we discovered the following:

City of Madison transport: transfer to Pete's book for 10/01 and forward MGAF transport:  write down 2007-2020 position.  Loss of about $500K - Scott 
as we spoke, I'll take the blame
LRC/Stringray positions:  Kam to review and explain
Annuity: Origination total of about 90K, net with 500 loss from above Alagasco:   Tammi deal, Sonat Tier 2 position
Others: As I explained to Kam, any gain from closing this book should be 
transferred for the
 account of Jared Kaiser

	""How to Kill A  Blonde""
	
	Score: 65
	(posted by Shella on  07/31/00)
	
	One Day, A Blonde walks into a hair salon with  headphones on. The  Hairstylist said:  
	
	""What would you like done today?""  
	
	The Blonde Answered...""I want to get my hair permed.""  
	
	""Well, you're gonna have to remove those headphones first.""  answered the  hairstylist.  
	
	""But I can't! My parents said that if I EVER take them off, I'll  die!"" The 
Blonde said  
	
	""Alright, I'm gonna go get the stuff I need, and when I come  back, you  better have those off."" the hairstylist replied. So as she  was walking into 
the backroom, the blonde appempted to take off the  headphones.   	
	When the hairstylist returned, she found the blonde sprawled out  on the  floor. She was dead. The hairstylist picked up the headphones  that were  laying next to her. There was a voice on the headphones  saying:   	
	""Breathe in, Breathe out, Breathe in, Breathe out, Breathe in,  Breathe  out.""

A beautiful woman loved growing tomatoes, but couldn't seem to get her  tomatoes to turn red. One day while taking a stroll she came upon a  gentleman neighbor who had the most beautiful garden full of huge red  tomatoes. 

The woman asked the gentleman, ""What do you do to get your tomatoes so  red?"" The gentleman responded, ""Twice a day I stand in front of my tomato  garden and expose myself, and my tomatoes turn red from blushing so much.""  
 The woman was so impressed, she decided to try doing the same 
 thing to her tomato garden to see if it would work. So twice a day for two 
weeks she exposed herself to her garden hoping for the best 

  One day the gentleman was passing by and asked the woman, ""By the way,  How did you make out? Did your tomatoes turn red?"" 

""No"" she replied, ""but my cucumbers are enormous!""",jons@amerexenergy.com,sandra.brawner@enron.com,female

A Preacher wanted to raise money for his church, and being told that there  was a fortune in Horse Racing, he decided to purchase a horse and enter him 
in the race.  However, at the local auction the going price for horses was  
so steep that he ended up buying a Donkey instead.  He figured that since he  
had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races, and to his   surprise, the Donkey came in third. 

The  next day the racing form carried this headline, ""Preacher's Ass shows"". 
The Preacher was so pleased with the  Donkey that he entered it in the race 
again, and this time it won.  The next day the form said, ""Preacher's Ass,  out in front!""

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity, that he ordered the  Preacher not to enter the Donkey in another race.  The newspaper printed  this headline; ""Bishop scratches Preacher's Ass."" 

This was just too much for the Bishop, and he ordered the Preacher to get rid 
of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a Nun in a nearby convent. 
The headline next day read, ""Nun has the best Ass in town."" 

The Bishop fainted. He informed the Nun that she would have to  
dispose of the Donkey. She finally found a Farmer who was willing to buy  it for $10. Next day the paper said, ""Nun peddles her Ass for ten bucks.""  They buried the Bishop the next day.",jons@amerexenergy.com,sandra.brawner@enron.com,female

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook  client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is  configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is  migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had  indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not  correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided  below. 

 It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp.  EH&S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  
will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.  Ken has over 25 year  experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas  industry.

"The first quarter of 2001 was a record quarter for the performance of the  businesses under the Enron Global Markets group.  We posted a gross margin  number of $100 million for the first quarter.  This represents a 38% increase 
in gross margin after a very successful Q1 of 2000.  When combined with  outstanding results posted in December of 2000, EGM has contributed over $187 
million to the Wholesale group in the last 4 months.  This was due to  tremendous contributions from each business group.

In order to keep the momentum going and to facilitate more growth, the  following changes and additions have been made within the organization.  
Crude and Products group
Mid-marketing
Bill Berkeland has joined the group and is responsible for creating a focused 
mid-marketing function specifically within this group.  Fred Lagrasta is  responsible for mid-marketing for Enron Americas and still maintains some  responsibility for various contacts and deal flow as well.  The purpose of  this group is to be very focused in the development of crude and product  specific products and services.  This group reports to Randy Maffett.   
Origination
In order to manage the increased origination opportunities around the world, 
the Origination group has been changed in order to insure that the proper  focus is placed on these opportunities and to manage its wide scope.  Doug  Friedman will lead our NGL and Petchem origination efforts reporting to John 
Nowlan.  Joining Doug will be Rick Cantrell recently hired from Union  Carbide.  The global crude and products origination group has added Randy O,
Conner from Red Meteor, who has extensive experience in these markets.  Both 
Randy and Doug Leach,s growing fuels origination group will report to Randy 
Maffett. 

Trading
Lee Jackson will assume the role of U.S. NGL,s lead financial trader,  supported by Chad South.  The petchem and plastic trading businesses have  been reorganized under Stuart Bland.  Alan Engberg will be responsible for  plastics trading in the Americas.  

Shipping
Scott Moncrieff will assume responsibility of our global shipping network  related to crude and products.  Scott will be charged with expanding all  aspects of the shipping portfolio taking advantage of our growing presence in 
these markets and the successes we have had marketing shipping on line. 
Weather
The weather group under Mark Tawney,s direction is expanding its efforts  around the world.  Europe will have an expanded focus and the London office 
will focus on new opportunities in Europe.  Paul Murray has joined Enron from 
Castlebridge Partners and will be moving to London to develop and expand the 
continental opportunities.  Ross McIntyre, currently based in London, will  report to Paul.  Bill Windle has joined the weather group and has  responsibility for origination activities for North America.  Bill,s most  recent assignment has been in the EBS organization.  The Oslo weather office 
managed by Thor Lien will have responsibility for Scandinavia weather  activities.  In addition, employees are being added in the Australia and  Japan regions.  We are now making markets in 32 cities around the world on  EnronOnline.  

Coal
Mark Schroeder has joined the coal group and is responsible for origination 
activities with generators in the U.S.  Mark,s most recent assignment was as 
the head of all regulatory activities for Enron Europe, Japan and Australia.

Enron Japan
The momentum of power deregulation process has slowed in Japan.  The decision 
has been made to scale back the wholesale power activities.   Joe Hirl,  President and CEO of Enron Japan, will now report into the EGM organization.  
Joe will maintain his direct responsibility of the office and will be  increasing his focus on the business lines within EGM.  All of these products 
have high growth potential in both the near and long-term and he will  coordinate and help implement with all the business lines and their  activities.

LNG
LNG continues to expand with the vision to increase the number of  transactions and create a portfolio of assets and contractual access around 
the world.  Jonathan Whitehead has joined the LNG group and has 
responsibility for all trading and shipping activities.

Neal Gerstandt, previously an independent energy consultant,  Jared Kaiser, 
from Enron Americas - East Gas Desk, and Kurt Lindahl, from Enron Global  Assets, have also joined the LNG group with responsibilities in the area of 
origination in the Western Region.

Enron Freight Markets
EFM has concluded over 2,000 transactions in its first two months.  Chris  Kravas continues to focus on building the spot trading and mid-market  capabilities that will enable it to be the dominant player in its market, and 
has hired four new traders in the last two weeks.  Kellie Metcalf, from EBS, 
has joined Shawn Cumberland's origination effort, and Deirdre McCaffrey, from 
Gas Structuring and Mid-Market, has joined Matt Arnold's forward trading  group focusing on diesel products.  

Global Risk Markets
David Hoog joined Enron from Ace Insurance in December 2000 and has quickly 
built a team of people specialized in trading unit contingent power price  call options, a hybrid insurance derivative product. Drawing on Ace and Enron 
resources, this team is based in New York and includes Alex Tartakovski and 
Larry Marcus from Ace, as well as Joana Bekerman and Tony Chang who recently 
moved to New York from Houston. Their first transaction closed just 3 months 
after startup.

Brad Blesie will be moving to London in June to establish a base of operation 
for GRM and expand our insurance derivative activities into the European  market place. Among the opportunities he is currently exploring are  contingent call options applied to shipping and charter rates, trading  insolvent insurance claims, and combining North Sea oil and gas VPP risk with 
decommissioning insurance.

In April this year, EGM established a hedge fund origination effort in New  York reporting to Per Sekse and led by Russell Dyk who recently moved to New 
York from LNG in Houston. Russell is responsible for expanding our commodity 
trading relationship with hedge funds to include crude oil, products, liquids 
and other commodities traded by EGM. Joining Russell in this effort is  Stephen Plauche, who comes to us from Enron Americas, power trading desk. 
Financial Trading
Elsa Piekielniak has assumed responsibility for Enron,s developing  agriculture business.  Billy Lemmons has changed groups and now runs the  Analyst and Associate program for Enron Corp.  

Please congratulate everyone on their new assignment and we look forward to 
the continued growth in all the EGM businesses.",enron.services@enron.com,enron.announcements@enron.com,unknown

"Hello Bill,

It was great to get your note today.  I also think of you often.  Thanks for 
the complements concerning Enron, as always I am very proud of Enron where  we've been and where it seems we are going.  Work is going well,  Business  with Prebon is still null.  Has nothing to do with Cathy I think she is a  great person and a  good broker, it just doesn't seem like they (Prebon) has 
any good information and markets anymore.  It is sad actually, ever since you 
left the group things have never been the same.  YOU made a big difference  there.

Yes I would love to try and meet with you.  I need more information though.  
Things are kinda hectic here and at home so timing is everything for me these 
days.  Lunch is out of the question.  So we are looking at drinks or dinner.  
the week of the 20th is better.  The week of the 25th is not going to be easy 
cuz it is settlement week.

Pam is doing fine.  Still looking for a job.  Hopefully something will happen 
soon.  She had mentioned that you wrote a note,  I guess I got the impression 
she had replied.  She is a little stressed in trying to get things settled in 
her life so just give her some time.",byoung@prebon.com,sandra.brawner@enron.com,female
"Dear Sandra,

I sincerely apologize if I offended you in any way Wednesday evening.  That was certainly never my intention. I let my competitive emotions take over. I
was attempting to compare myself with other brokers not any specific shop. If I singled certain brokers out that was not my intention.  I was honestly trying to stress that I really work hard to earn the business.

I can truly say that I slept very little that night reflecting on things that were discussed in our dinner.  After pondering the discussion about the
firmness of physical gas, I was afraid that I did not communicate my point well and insulted your intelligence and your ability to judge the intelligence of your brokers.  I certainly would never purposely do that. I respect your reputation in the market and your knowledge of the market. Upon
reflection of the conversation, I did not communicate my points concerning physical, and I cannot say enough that it was not my intention to insult you
(whether you work at Enron or not).

I have reviewed the conversation with Steve and Jon (Ray is at lunch), and I
can honestly say I was trying to point out Enron's strength in the marketplace.  I chose the West as the example because of the volatility.  I certainly meant it on how the market has changed; NOT how Enron manipulates the market or is putting traders out of jobs.

I am embarrassed that I lost my composure.  I felt you were trying to challenge our group to raise our level of game (which you did).  I did not mean to dominate the conversation from Natsource's point of view.  Steve and
I agreed that we both could have handled the discussions much better.  I do not blame Steve as my boss or Jon as the desk head for not stopping the conversation.  I am an adult and a professional so I take full
responsibility. As brokers, our job is to communicate.  Clearly, we failed in this regard.

I obviously would like to make it up to you and your firm.  I hope my lack of composure does not cost my entire firm any of Enron's business.  I hope I
can work through the issues I created for the Gulf desk.  I will take it personally to take your points about our desk and make them happen.  I do not want you uncomfortable with anyone who speaks with you.  Your respect for Ray is obvious, and I will try to support whatever you decide to the fullest.

"Last month you received an email about enrolling in the Enron PAC.  The  response has been positive.  
Thank you to those of you that have already enrolled or made a change to your 
current contribution!  
If you have not had an opportunity to visit the enrollment site, please  consider taking a moment to do so.  The link to the website is at the end of 
this message.

 Some of you may have experienced problems launching the site or enrolling.  
We apologize for any trouble that you may have had.  The enrollment works  best in either Internet Explorer or Netscape.  The most frequent problems  were a result of the Lotus Notes web browser that many employees have  installed as a default browser.  If this is your case, please copy and paste 
the link at the end of this message into either Internet Explorer or Netscape.

As a reminder - Following is the original message regarding the PAC  enrollment:

Last year the Enron Political Action Committee (PAC) launched a campaign to 
become a ""million dollar PAC"".  Enron employees, who provide all of the  funding for the PAC, responded and the Enron PAC reached its objective,  becoming one of the largest corporate PACs.  This year we face a new  challenge.  With the sale of EOG, the announced sale of PGE and normal  employee turnover, we have lost a significant number of consistent  contributors.  We are seeking your support.  If you are not a member, please 
join.  If you are a member, we hope you will consider increasing your  contribution.

The Enron PAC is an essential tool in our effort to promote sound public  policy.  Our PAC funds support local, state and federal candidates, of both 
parties, who support open markets, deregulation and customer choice.  Amounts 
contributed may be used to make political contributions in connection with  federal and state elections and are subject to the limits of the Federal  Election Campaign Act.  While our PAC has grown thanks to our employee  contributions, it still generates just a fraction of the expenditures of  those who oppose these ideals.

This year, as always, we face challenges and opportunities for every one of 
our businesses, including such issues as taxation and regulation of  e-commerce, electric industry restructuring, regulation of derivatives,  international trade and investment legislation, pipeline safety, local and  state decisions affecting the siting and interconnection of power plants and 
a variety of environmental and tax issues.  Enron has a long and successful 
track record of supporting and advancing good public policy.  That track  record depends on access to and regular communication with, decision makers.  
The PAC provides that access - - it shows policy makers that real voters care 
about what they are doing.

One of the best things about Enron is that we don,t just take things as they 
are.  We challenge the status quo.  We ask why.  We change things.  The PAC 
helps us do that.  We need you to help the PAC.  Sign up today ) and please 
consider the following contribution guidelines:

Manager $500/year
Director  $750/year
Sr. Director/General Manager  $1,000/year
Vice President $2,500/year
Sr. VP/Managing Director  $3,500/year
Executive Committee   $5,000/year

All contributions are voluntary and these guidelines are merely suggestions.  
You are free to contribute more or less than the guidelines suggested and  Enron will not favor or disadvantage anyone by reason of the amount of their 
contribution or their decision not to contribute.  You may refuse to  contribute without fear of reprisal.

Only U.S. citizens and resident-aliens living in the U.S. can contribute to 
the Enron PAC.  Amounts contributed may be used to make contributions in  connection with federal and state elections and are subject to the  limitations of the Federal Election Campaign Act.  The maximum contribution 
is $5,000 per year per individual.  An individual may not contribute more  than $25,000 to all federal candidates and committees within a calendar  year.  The law requires that Enron report name, address, employer and  occupation for every person who contributes over $200/year.

No portion of any contribution is deductible as a charitable contribution for 
federal income tax purposes.

Thanks for your support!  Sign up now, or revise your current contribution  level by connecting with the PAC intranet site:

"I appreciate your note and yes it has been awhile since we spoke.  I do chat 
with Ray occasionally.  Steve without sounding abrupt I still have no  intention of doing business with your shop.  That situation was difficult   for several of us involved, and it is not something  that I believe I will  forget. nor understand.  


Sincerely,

Sandra",stouchstone@natsource.com,sandra.brawner@enron.com,female
